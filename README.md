# A-MDVRP
This repository provides the latest C++ implementation of the branch-and-cut framework and the valid inequalities that we used to write "Asymmetric multi-depot vehicle routing problems: valid inequalities and a branch-and-cut algorithm".
The exact version as used while writing the manuscript can be found as an online supplement to the publication, see: https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2020.2033. 

If you have any questions, comments, and/or suggestions, please do not hesistate to contact us via a.j.uit.het.broek@rug.nl and a.h.schrotenboer@rug.nl. If you found our code useful, then you can cite the work as follows:
