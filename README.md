# A-MDVRP
This repository provides the latest C++ implementation of the branch-and-cut framework and the valid inequalities that we used to write "Asymmetric multi-depot vehicle routing problems: valid inequalities and a branch-and-cut algorithm".
The exact version as used while writing the manuscript can be found as an online suplement to the publication (doi url here). 

If you have any questions, comments, and/or suggestions, please do not hesistate to contact us via a.j.uit.het.broek@rug.nl and a.h.schrotenboer@rug.nl.

If you found our code useful and would like to thank us, then you can cite the work as follows

--  The code will be made available immediately once the manuscript is accepted --
