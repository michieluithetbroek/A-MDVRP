The functions in this folder are the only functions that process the output files.
The data is stored in mdvrp/analysis_new/tuning

Reading the data files is handled by the following structs:
 - resultSingleFile.h
 - resultMergedSetting.h
 
The former is the only function/file that reads input files. Thus, if the template
of these data files changes, then this is the only function that should be changed
accordingly.

The second struct uses the first struct to read all instances of a specific problem
type. It translates the results into some statistics (e.g., number of instances 
solved to optimality). 

The formatting of the data (i.e., printing TeX output) is handled by the cc files.
